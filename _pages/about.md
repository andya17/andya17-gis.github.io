This is a website to display my GIS-related work from Middlebury College. I am a senior at Middlebury majoring in Conservation Biology, which is a major that combines Environmental Studies and Biology. Beyond the required GIS class GEOG 0150: Mapping Global Environmental Change, I have also completed the course GEOG 0310: Conservation Planning, in which students contributed to a conservation plan for the Town of Middlebury. I am currently enrolled in the course GEOG 0361: Open GIScience.
