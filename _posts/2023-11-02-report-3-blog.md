This reanalysis pertains to a paper by Spielman et al. (2020) involving the social vulnerability index (SoVI). For this assignment, the GEOG0323 class analyzed a particular set of static changes made to the workflow by Professor Joseph Holler, namely whether reweighting the principal components in principal component analysis (PCA) by percentage of variance explained would have an impact on the study. I aimed to discuss whether this affected internal consistency and construct validity based on how certain figures changed.

From this reanalysis, I have learned about SoVI, including its history and how it has been used by government bodies in recent years. I also learned more about PCA as a statistical method and how it could be implemented in Python code. This was one of my first experiences with Python, so I am grateful to be able to have a workflow from which to see how to use important packages for spatial analysis work.
