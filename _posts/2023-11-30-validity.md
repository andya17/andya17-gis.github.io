- For boundary/edge effects to apply, I gather that the project would involve a neighborhood calculation which may produce incorrect values at the study boundary. From the file "Makuyuni Wildlife Corridor 2.0 Combined", it appears that edge effects have been specifically accounted for.
- The Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem could be a factor because the authors indicate that they used "hand-digitized corridors". I would have to read more about the MAUP in order to determine how that could be addressed, if it is indeed an issue.
- Spatial dependency may have been addressed through sampling in transects. I do not believe there would be control sites/transects for the study conducted, so the control/experiment dichotomy mentioned in the slideshow on this topic may not apply.
- It also seems that spatial nonstationarity has been addressed through ground-truthing the inclusion of all habitat types, but it is noted that one area was not easily accessed for sampling. I do not believe I would be able to change anything about this, seeing as this process required in-person work.

Note: I am not able to access the linked paper by Schmitt. I will request the paper through ILL.
