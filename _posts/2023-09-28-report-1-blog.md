From doing a reproduction study, I have learned that integrating the thoughts of multiple authors can be a complicated process. I also learned about parameters in the kableExtra and the tmap R packages. The reproduction most clearly differs in the discussion section and the conclusion section, the latter of which did not exist in the previous version of the reproduction study. I would hope that these changes, along with small changes to three specific figures, are improvements to the study. In particular, I believe that forming one discussion section should improve the readability of the report and decrease time in which a reader moves from one discussion section to another to discern differences in content.

As stated by Emily in the discussion section, there are further opportunities to improve the study; notably, researchers could choose a more appropriate model for themes of "spatial dependence". I look forward to learning more about said models in the future.

With respect to replication studies, researchers could use COVID-19 incidence from a different time period in the United States. Researchers could also use data from another country to investigate the relationship between the variables there.
