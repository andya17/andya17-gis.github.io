Much of the work for this reanalysis of the reproduction study of Malcomb et al. (2014) involved building a discussion and conclusion section to assist with explaining the possible sources of error and uncertainty in the original study, particularly using some of the terms which Tate (2013) uses in his framework. The authors of the reproduction study included that the naming conventions for some of the terms in the original study, such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity, changed at points throughout the paper. I mainly chose to analyze the two figures in the reproduction study which compare figures from the original study with the reproduction study, for their differences suggest that the planned deviations made from the workflow of the original study impacted the results.

In the process of completing this reanalysis, I learned more about the structure of spatial analysis packages in R, including "sf". I also learned about the importance of internal consistency with respect to the definitions of terms. I hope that I have been able to contribute some of a fruitful discussion on the comparison figures and that I have offered a  measured perspective on whether the reproduction was successful, which was a point of discussion for the last report.
